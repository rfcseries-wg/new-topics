# Contributing to RSWG

Anyone can contribute to RSWG; you don't have to join the Working Group, because there is no "membership" -- anyone who participates in the work, as outlined below, is part of the RSWG Working Group.

Before doing so, it's a good idea to familiarize yourself with our [charter](https://datatracker.ietf.org/rfcedtyp/rswg/about/). If you're new to this, you may also want to read [an informal guide to the IETF process](https://www.ietf.org/standards/process/informal/) and the [Tao of the IETF](https://www.ietf.org/tao.html).
## Contributing to Work in Progress

The RSWG is not an IETF Working Group but generally follows IETF procedures as detailed below. The specific process for the RSWG is defined in [RFC 9280](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9280).


### Following Discussion

The RSWG Working Group has a few venues for discussion:

* We have a session at most [IETF meetings](https://www.ietf.org/meeting/), and sometimes in between (called an "interim" meeting). See our [meeting materials repository](https://github.com/rfcseries-wg/wg-materials), and the [official IETF proceedings](https://datatracker.ietf.org/rfcedtyp/rswg/meetings/) for details.

* Our [mailing list](https://mailman.rfc-editor.org/mailman/listinfo/rswg) is used for notifications of meetings, adoption of documents, consensus calls, issue discussion, and other business. This is the primary discussion venue.

* We use GitHub to track issues, but not for discussion. New topics for discussion should be filed in the New Topics repository (https://github.com/rfcseries-wg/new-topics).

To be active in the Working Group, you can participate in any or all of these places.


### Raising New Topics

If you have a new topic you believe the WG should discuss, please file an issue it in the New Topics repository  (https://github.com/rfcseries-wg/new-topics). You should also e-mail the mailing list so people are aware of it.

Before filing a new issue, please consider a few things:

* There may be an existing duplicate issue, so please review the issues list first.

* If you're not sure how to phrase your issue, please ask on the [mailing list](https://mailman.rfc-editor.org/mailman/listinfo/rswg).

New topics can also be raised on the [Working Group mailing list](https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/browse/rswg/) by clearly marking them as such (e.g., in the `Subject:` line).

Be aware that issues might be rephrased, changed in scope, or combined with others, so that the group can focus its efforts. If you feel that such a change loses an important part of your original issue, please bring it up, either in comments or on the mailing list.

Off-topic and duplicate issues will be closed without discussion. 

## Code of Conduct

The [IETF Guidelines for Conduct](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7154) applies to all Working Group communications and meetings.


## NOTE WELL

Any submission to the [IETF](https://www.ietf.org/) intended by the Contributor for publication as all or part of an IETF Internet-Draft or RFC and any statement made within the context of an IETF activity is considered an "IETF Contribution". Such statements include oral statements in IETF sessions, as well as written and electronic communications made at any time or place, which are addressed to:

 * The IETF plenary session
 * The IESG, or any member thereof on behalf of the IESG
 * Any IETF mailing list, including the IETF list itself, any working group or design team list, or
   any other list functioning under IETF auspices
 * Any IETF working group or portion thereof
 * Any Birds of a Feather (BOF) session
 * The IAB or any member thereof on behalf of the IAB
 * The RFC Editor or the Internet-Drafts function
 * All IETF Contributions are subject to the rules of [RFC
   5378](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5378) and [RFC 3979](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3979)
   (updated by [RFC 4879](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4879)).

Statements made outside of an IETF session, mailing list or other function, that are clearly not
intended to be input to an IETF activity, group or function, are not IETF Contributions in the context of this notice.

Please consult [RFC 5378](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5378) and [RFC 3979](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3979) for details.

A participant in any IETF activity is deemed to accept all IETF rules of process, as documented in Best Current Practices RFCs and IESG Statements.

A participant in any IETF activity acknowledges that written, audio and video records of meetings may be made and may be available to the public.
